Introduction

A digital thermometer is used to verify a smart temperature transmitter under flowing conditions and a successful calibration of the smart temperature transmitter. Portable electronic thermometers (PETs) are designed to measure temperature in a RTD-type thermowell using a thermistor or RTD probe. A thermometer has two important elements: a temperature sensor in which some change occurs with a change in temperature; and some means of converting this change into a numerical value they can be used to take temperature readings in the mouth, rectum, or armpit. When assessing digital thermometer readings, keep in mind that armpit (axillary) temperature runs about ½ to 1°F (0.6°C) cooler than oral readings.
